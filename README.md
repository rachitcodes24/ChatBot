🚀 Built a Basic Text-Based Chatbot in Python! 🤖

I recently created a simple chatbot in Python using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to process user input and generate conversational responses. It’s a great project for those looking to understand the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and how chatbots work behind the scenes.

📝 Program Overview:
The chatbot simulates basic human-like conversations by understanding user inputs, removing irrelevant words, and responding based on the words it recognizes. Here’s how it works:

💡 How It Works:
Text Preprocessing:

The chatbot first cleans the user's input by removing punctuation and stopwords (common words like "the", "is", "and") that don’t add much meaning to the conversation.
It then tokenizes the input, breaking it down into individual words to analyze them further.
Using Synonyms:

To make the chatbot more conversational and flexible, it uses WordNet from NLTK to find synonyms of words entered by the user. This allows the bot to recognize a broader range of vocabulary and better match predefined responses to the user’s input.
Predefined Responses:

The chatbot replies with a set of predefined, generic responses based on the recognized words or their synonyms. If no clear match is found, it selects a random response to keep the conversation going.
Basic Flow Control:

The conversation continues until the user types “bye,” at which point the chatbot exits gracefully by saying goodbye.
